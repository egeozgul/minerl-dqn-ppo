# Efficient Item Collection in Minecraft

Reinforcement learning agents for collecting wood logs in Minecraft using the [MineRL](https://minerl.io/) benchmark. This project implements and compares **DQN** and **PPO** on `MineRLObtainDiamondShovel-v0`, with a focus on sample efficiency, training stability, and reward shaping for log collection.

## Overview

| Algorithm | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| DQN | [`notebooks/train_dqn.ipynb`](notebooks/train_dqn.ipynb) | Custom CNN, experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration |
| PPO | [`scripts/train_ppo.py`](scripts/train_ppo.py) | Stable-Baselines3 with simplified discrete action space |

Both agents use POV (pixel) observations resized to 64×64, a reduced action space (10 discrete actions), and custom reward shaping that rewards log collection.

## Architecture

### DQN

Experience replay with a periodically synced target network for stable Q-value learning.

### PPO

Shared CNN backbone with separate actor (policy) and critic (value) heads.

## Results

### DQN Training Rewards

Episode reward and 10-episode moving average over 119 training episodes. The agent starts with near-zero rewards during exploration, then shows a clear learning signal after ~60 episodes as log-collection behavior emerges. Final moving average reaches ~0.08, with peak episode rewards up to ~0.16.

### PPO Training Rewards

Smoothed reward curve over ~85,000 training steps. Performance stays flat through early exploration (~55k steps), then improves steadily as the policy converges — reaching a smoothed reward of ~0.25 by the end of training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Java 8 (required by MineRL / Malmo)
- CUDA-capable GPU recommended (CPU training is supported but slow)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egeozgul/MineRL.git
cd MineRL

python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install minerl
```

> **Note:** MineRL requires additional system setup (Java, display/headless config). See the [official docs](https://minerl.io/docs/) if environment creation fails.

## Usage

### DQN

Open and run [`notebooks/train_dqn.ipynb`](notebooks/train_dqn.ipynb). Pre-trained weights are in [`checkpoints/`](checkpoints/).

### PPO

```bash
python scripts/train_ppo.py
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `TOTAL_TIMESTEPS` | 1000 | Training timesteps |
| `TOTAL_EPISODES` | 50 | Evaluation episodes after training |
| `MAX_STEPS_PER_EPISODE` | 1000 | Episode length cap |
| `SHOWFRAMES` | `False` | Save episode frames to disk |
| `LEARNING_RATE` | `1e-3` | PPO learning rate |
